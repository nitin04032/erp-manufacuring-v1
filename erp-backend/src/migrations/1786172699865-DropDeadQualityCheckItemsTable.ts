/**
 * Audit fix #1 (AUDIT_REPORT.md §3.1): `quality_check_items` was created by
 * a dead, unused pair of entity classes (src/quality-checks/quality-check.entity.ts
 * and quality-check-item.entity.ts, deleted alongside this migration) that
 * duplicated the real, live `QualityCheck`/`QCItem` entities under
 * src/quality-checks/entities/ — which map to `quality_checks`/`qc_items`.
 *
 * Nothing in the application ever read or wrote `quality_check_items`; it
 * was pure schema noise sitting alongside the real `qc_items` table. Since
 * TypeORM loads entities via a glob (see app.module.ts), the dead classes
 * were also silently registered in ORM metadata alongside the real
 * `QualityCheck` entity, both mapped to the same `quality_checks` table name.
